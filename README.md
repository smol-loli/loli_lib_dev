# loli-lib

## Notice
This is just a fun project of mine for learning the basics of Rust and Cargo. Therefore, DO NOT RECOMMEND to use this crate in production.

## Usage
If you really want to use this package... Yay! That makes me very happy❤️

Currently, I only implemented a few hashing functions, but I'll add more functionality as time goes on. Please refer to the documentation for how to use this crate.

### Example
```Rust
use crate loli_lib_dev::hashing::*;

let input = "Hiiii"

// Hash the input with
let hashed = hash_sha3_512(input);
```
